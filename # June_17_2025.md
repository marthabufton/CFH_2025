## Notes for Workshop 3

- did not write the initial insgructions for connecting repository to file, had to delete the original respository and start again. Could copy and paste instructions because I have done these steps before.
- Cannot forget to put in the name of the repository to connect the folder to the repository.
- Perhaps we need to assume that we need Weeks 2 and 3 for the git/github connecgion and introduction to literary programming.
